checklist
-------------------------------------------

// print
[X]	string builder for class

// core functionality
[X]	basic/primative properties
[X]	Lists, enumerations, arrays, etc. (of simple/primative props)
	// another prop holding other info like isEnumerable etc.
[X]	Nullables
	// another prop holding metadata like isNullable
[X]	Nullable Classes
[X]	Child properties
[X]  Lists, arrays, enumerations, etc (of other Classes)

// annotations
[X] add the ability to add notation [spindll("[some-annotation]")]

// v1.0 checkpoint!
[X]	single file executable (dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained false)
[]	put exec in /lib or /bin and use relative paths from within a project to watch/run
[]	add parent project to run either watcher or single run spindll ie "spindll -w -i . -o /testoutputs"
[]	relative paths
[] 	cleanup, reorganize, modularize!
[]	setup watcher to watch for folder changes in certain folder!
[]  spindll input output

// usability 
[]	should be callable as a post build step, or run with a config file

// display
[]	Group Ids at top of file

// enhancements
[]  Add debounce (1 sec)
[]  Dictionaries
[]  Allow existing text to persist


// usability:
[]	starting the watcher should be part of the build processes
[]	watcher should only listen for ~ 30sec or 1 completion, whatever comes second.
[]  configure command line params ie:
		> spindll src:"/home/myr/_repo/spindll/spindll/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.0/spindll.dll" output:"/home/myr/_repo/spindll/spindll/_testOutputs/"
[]	single file publish:
		> dotnet publish -r linux-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained false
